Hello Integral!

In the project found here please find my submission.

It uses Gradle and Java 15 and below you'll find a list of libraries included in as gradle dependencies:
* junit-jupiter-api: 5.7.0
* junit-jupiter-engine: 5.7.0
* spring-boot-starter-web: 2.5.1
* gson: 2.8.6
* mockito-inline: 3.7.7

In the 'resources' directory, you'll find data.json. This file contains all my test data you don't have to do anything with it as it will be loaded on app startup.

I built and ran this using IntelliJ and didn't configure it for the sake of time, so when you start the application you simply should be able to navigate to your browser to localhost:8080.

Once you've navigated to localhost:8080 enter a name from the data.json file (I recommend 'Wayne', but there are better profiles out there) and away you go!

Please reach out to me if you have any issues running the project. I'd be more than happy to look at the issue.
